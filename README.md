# Advent of Code 2022

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) 2022 contribution! The solutions are written in JavaScript using Node.js. When writing the solutions code I primarily aim for readability but try to always keep performance considerations in mind (thought the latter strongly depends on how much time I can spend). Happy reading!

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of code is made by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

> [It is] an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

For more information see [about Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about).

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Run the code via 
```
node dayXX/partX.js
```
